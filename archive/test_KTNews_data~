I also agree with him that Kenyans have 'sadly, only embraced the negative aspects of tribalism'. \nI am very proud of my Luo heritage, and I will forever respect our  other rich Kenyans tribes. \n\nOne vital element that Anil fails to put into consideration however, when he lauds tribal groupings in football, is that it is these tribal vices that have majorly contributed to the downfall of this great country. Tribalism bore root to nepotism in the early stages of our beloved country's political foundation. Tribalism created major political issues that we have at the moment. We have bogus leaders in office, just because their tribes produce more numbers during elections.\n\nFootball is a great sport. Our Kenyan football has a long way to go as far as quality and management are concerned. \n\nTribal labelling of clubs like Gor and AFC have simply got to stop, for the better of this great sport. \nI am not sure Mr. Anil understands that the players are the main reason this great sport is revered. If he did, then he would have obviously noticed that Gor Mahia has got players from other tribes other than Luo (Mutiso, Mosoti, Wekesa, Lavatsa) and so has AFC other than Luhya (Kimani, Opiyo, the scorer for the GOTV Final match)\n\nI am just wondering how I would feel, as a Luo, playing for a team that Mr. Anil labels as a 'Luhya team'. Should I thenbe called a traitor? Should I change my tribe? Or shouldn't I even consider playing for a team that isn't related to my tribe? \n\nMr Anil's line of thought is well-intentioned. But I believe he fails to understand the detrimental eventualities that tribalism will induce in our football. \n\nSo, with all due respect, Mr. Anil, you're wrong. Community groupings should NEVER be even considered a future for our Kenyan football. \n\nOne more thing; you mentioned that the Kalenjin 'have their place in athletics'. What an uninformed and unfair perspective! Perhaps you don't follow our athletics well, Mr Anil. Our marathoners have come from several tribes. John Ngugi, Geoffrey Mutai, Wanjiru (the late), just to mention a few. \nThis tribal line of thought is not what I would like my child to grow up with. \n\nKeep tribalism out of sports. It's perhaps the only pride Kenya is clutching onto, as we watch our country crumble. \nWe scream out our lungs, watching the Olympics, chanting, \"KENYA!\" We never scream \"Kalenjin\".","from":{"name":"Siaji Otieno","id":"629631562"},"created_time":"2013-11-18T12:32:31+0000"},{"id":"10153502828840533_25031844","message":"KTN at it again! ety the POSITIVE side of tribalism?! wtf??

The senior Jomo Kenyatta saw off his political rivals Jaramogi Oginga Odinga and Martin Shikuku through detention without trial. Some of his rivals like Tom Mboya and J.M. Kariuki were murdered in mysterious circumstances. Uhuru Kenyatta only wants to use the Presidency to avoid trial at ICC and does not care about the welfare of Kenyans. That is why crime and insecurity have reached unprecedented levels in Kenya under his watch. In just 7 months of his administration, the main Airport has burned down, Westgate Mall has been attacked with massive casualties and murder, arson, kidnappings, rape and cattle rustling have reached unprecedented levels. There is no question that Uhuru Kenyatta prefers to rule the way his father did.

The senior Jomo Kenyatta saw off his political rivals Jaramogi Oginga Odinga and Martin Shikuku through detention without trial. Some of his rivals like Tom Mboya and J.M. Kariuki were murdered in mysterious circumstances. Uhuru Kenyatta only wants to use the Presidency to avoid trial at ICC and does not care about the welfare of Kenyans. That is why crime and insecurity have reached unprecedented levels in Kenya under his watch. In just 7 months of his administration, the main Airport has burned down, Westgate Mall has been attacked with massive casualties and murder, arson, kidnappings, rape and cattle rustling have reached unprecedented levels. There is no question that Uhuru Kenyatta prefers to rule the way his father did. Unfortunately, Kenyans of today would never accept to go back to those dark days.","from":{"category":"Community","name":"Intellect Philanthropy","id":"523181627696382"},"created_time":"2013-11-18T11:04:48+0000"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MQ==","before":"MTg="}}}},{"message":"Want to get ahead at the workplace?

We are however aware that\r\nforeigners are the ones who are\r\ntaking over the positions left by\r\nKenyans. This is unacceptable and I\r\nwill not keep quiet about it. Watch\r\nthis space closely! You will hear more\r\nof what we are going to do about it. I\r\nam not going to sit back when I see\r\nKenyans being subjected to suffering\r\nby a few greedy individuals.\r\nAs a leader, we cannot allow few\r\nindividuals to frustrate fellow\r\nKenyans through unnecessary layoffs\r\nyet Kenyans are counting on us as\r\nleaders to create jobs. It is important\r\nto note that the Aviation and Allied\r\nWorkers' Union went to the Industrial\r\nCourt and on 3rd December, 2012\r\nand the judge ruled in favour of the\r\nstaff and gave orders reinstating\r\nthem back to their jobs.\r\nWhat is shocking is that immediately\r\nKenya Airways retrenched its staff for\r\nreasons of financial constraints, it\r\nbegan recruiting staff from Thailand,\r\nIndia, Cameroon and Ghana.\r\nWhy should we sack fellow Kenyans\r\nand give same jobs to expatriates? As\r\na result of the retrenchment, there\r\nhas been an increase in staff need as\r\nwas witnessed in the month of\r\nOctober 2013 when Kenya Airways\r\nexperienced 26 flight delays from\r\nNairobi's JKIA due to lack of cabin\r\ncrew.\r\nAs things stands now there is a short\r\nfall of 139 cabin crew at Kenya\r\nAirways after retrenching 150 cabin\r\ncrew who are still out of employment.\r\nThe management of Kenya Airways\r\nmust tell Kenyans the truth about\r\nthe controversial retrenchment.\r\nAs leaders playing oversight for the\r\nexecutive to ensure proper delivery of\r\nservices, corrupt judiciary officials\r\nmust be kicked out. In this particular\r\ncase, Justice Rika rendered his\r\njudgment on 3rd December, 2012\r\nreinstating the retrenched staff and\r\nout rightly declined to stay his\r\norders.
