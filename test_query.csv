I also agree with him that Kenyans have 'sadly, only embraced the negative aspects of tribalism'.  I am very proud of my Luo heritage, and I will forever respect our  other rich Kenyans tribes.   One vital element that Anil fails to put into consideration however, when he lauds tribal groupings in football, is that it is these tribal vices that have majorly contributed to the downfall of this great country. Tribalism bore root to nepotism in the early stages of our beloved country's political foundation. Tribalism created major political issues that we have at the moment. We have bogus leaders in office, just because their tribes produce more numbers during elections.  Football is a great sport. Our Kenyan football has a long way to go as far as quality and management are concerned.   Tribal labelling of clubs like Gor and AFC have simply got to stop, for the better of this great sport.  I am not sure Mr. Anil understands that the players are the main reason this great sport is revered. If he did, then he would have obviously noticed that Gor Mahia has got players from other tribes other than Luo (Mutiso, Mosoti, Wekesa, Lavatsa) and so has AFC other than Luhya (Kimani, Opiyo, the scorer for the GOTV Final match)  I am just wondering how I would feel, as a Luo, playing for a team that Mr. Anil labels as a 'Luhya team'. Should I thenbe called a traitor? Should I change my tribe? Or shouldn't I even consider playing for a team that isn't related to my tribe?   Mr Anil's line of thought is well-intentioned. But I believe he fails to understand the detrimental eventualities that tribalism will induce in our football.   So, with all due respect, Mr. Anil, you're wrong. Community groupings should NEVER be even considered a future for our Kenyan football.   One more thing; you mentioned that the Kalenjin 'have their place in athletics'. What an uninformed and unfair perspective! Perhaps you don't follow our athletics well, Mr Anil. Our marathoners have come from several tribes. John Ngugi, Geoffrey Mutai, Wanjiru (the late), just to mention a few.  This tribal line of thought is not what I would like my child to grow up with.   Keep tribalism out of sports. It's perhaps the only pride Kenya is clutching onto, as we watch our country crumble.  We scream out our lungs, watching the Olympics, chanting, "KENYA!" We never scream "Kalenjin".",Siaji Otieno,629631562,2013-11-18T12:32:31+0000

We are however aware that foreigners are the ones who are taking over the positions left by Kenyans. This is unacceptable and I will not keep quiet about it. Watch this space closely! You will hear more of what we are going to do about it. I am not going to sit back when I see Kenyans being subjected to suffering by a few greedy individuals. As a leader, we cannot allow few individuals to frustrate fellow Kenyans through unnecessary layoffs yet Kenyans are counting on us as leaders to create jobs. It is important to note that the Aviation and Allied Workers' Union went to the Industrial Court and on 3rd December, 2012 and the judge ruled in favour of the staff and gave orders reinstating them back to their jobs. What is shocking is that immediately Kenya Airways retrenched its staff for reasons of financial constraints, it began recruiting staff from Thailand, India, Cameroon and Ghana. Why should we sack fellow Kenyans and give same jobs to expatriates? As a result of the retrenchment, there has been an increase in staff need as was witnessed in the month of October 2013 when Kenya Airways experienced 26 flight delays from Nairobi's JKIA due to lack of cabin crew. As things stands now there is a short fall of 139 cabin crew at Kenya Airways after retrenching 150 cabin crew who are still out of employment. The management of Kenya Airways must tell Kenyans the truth about the controversial retrenchment. As leaders playing oversight for the executive to ensure proper delivery of services, corrupt judiciary officials must be kicked out. In this particular case, Justice Rika rendered his judgment on 3rd December, 2012 reinstating the retrenched staff and out rightly declined to stay his orders. However as the matter was still pending at the Court of Appeal, they went back to the Industrial Court and strangely obtained stay orders before another Judge. This is questionable and needs proper investigations…………….’",Edna Kweyu,100003838733699,2013-11-18T11:07:53+0000

The senior Jomo Kenyatta saw off his political rivals Jaramogi Oginga Odinga and Martin Shikuku through detention without trial. Some of his rivals like Tom Mboya and J.M. Kariuki were murdered in mysterious circumstances. Uhuru Kenyatta only wants to use the Presidency to avoid trial at ICC and does not care about the welfare of Kenyans. That is why crime and insecurity have reached unprecedented levels in Kenya under his watch. In just 7 months of his administration, the main Airport has burned down, Westgate Mall has been attacked with massive casualties and murder, arson, kidnappings, rape and cattle rustling have reached unprecedented levels. There is no question that Uhuru Kenyatta prefers to rule the way his father did.

We are however aware that foreigners are the ones who are taking over the positions left by Kenyans. This is unacceptable and I will not keep quiet about it. Watch this space closely! You will hear more of what we are going to do about it. I am not going to sit back when I see Kenyans being subjected to suffering by a few greedy individuals. As a leader, we cannot allow few individuals to frustrate fellow Kenyans through unnecessary layoffs yet Kenyans are counting on us as leaders to create jobs. It is important to note that the Aviation and Allied Workers' Union went to the Industrial Court and on 3rd December, 2012 and the judge ruled in favour of the staff and gave orders reinstating them back to their jobs. What is shocking is that immediately Kenya Airways retrenched its staff for reasons of financial constraints, it began recruiting staff from Thailand, India, Cameroon and Ghana. Why should we sack fellow Kenyans and give same jobs to expatriates? As a result of the retrenchment, there has been an increase in staff need as was witnessed in the month of October 2013 when Kenya Airways experienced 26 flight delays from Nairobi's JKIA due to lack of cabin crew. As things stands now there is a short fall of 139 cabin crew at Kenya Airways after retrenching 150 cabin crew who are still out of employment. The management of Kenya Airways must tell Kenyans the truth about the controversial retrenchment. As leaders playing oversight for the executive to ensure proper delivery of services, corrupt judiciary officials must be kicked out. In this particular case, Justice Rika rendered his judgment on 3rd December, 2012 reinstating the retrenched staff and out rightly declined to stay his orders. However as the matter was still pending at the Court of Appeal, they went back to the Industrial Court and strangely obtained stay orders before another Judge. This is questionable and needs proper investigations…………….’",Edna Kweyu,100003838733699,2013-11-18T11:07:23+0000

The senior Jomo Kenyatta saw off his political rivals Jaramogi Oginga Odinga and Martin Shikuku through detention without trial. Some of his rivals like Tom Mboya and J.M. Kariuki were murdered in mysterious circumstances. Uhuru Kenyatta only wants to use the Presidency to avoid trial at ICC and does not care about the welfare of Kenyans. That is why crime and insecurity have reached unprecedented levels in Kenya under his watch. In just 7 months of his administration, the main Airport has burned down, Westgate Mall has been attacked with massive casualties and murder, arson, kidnappings, rape and cattle rustling have reached unprecedented levels. There is no question that Uhuru Kenyatta prefers to rule the way his father did.
